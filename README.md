# TDD Mail Chess [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LupineDev/tdd_chess.png?branch=fizz_buzz)](https://travis-ci.org/LupineDev/tdd_chess)

Between @LupineDev & @nrn, currently working *collaboratively* to
implement *fizzbuzz*

Run the tests with `bundle exec rspec spec`

If a test is failing write the minimum amount of code to make the test
pass.

If all tests are green from the last commiter write a *single* test to
describe the piece of behavior.
